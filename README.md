# AI earth hackathon

Task for this hackathon is to “develop an 
algorithmic tool that features generative AI to 
assist in the evaluation of ideas.”


AI EarthHack invites you to leverage the transformative power of generative AI in developing an AI-powered decision-support tool. Such a tool would not only streamline the evaluation process but also enhance the accuracy and efficiency of selecting the best solutions. By augmenting human judgment with AI’s analytical capabilities, we aim to spotlight those innovations that hold the most promise in addressing the pressing issue of climate change through the principles of the circular economy.

During AI EarthHack, your challenge is to evaluate innovative circular economy business opportunities that were crowdsourced from an exciting innovation contest to Unlock the Potential of a Circular Economy in Spring 2023.
